To use CSFLE with the driver, you need to have the `MongoDB.Driver.Encryption <https://www.nuget.org/packages/MongoDB.Driver.Encryption>`_
nuget package. This package bundles libmongocrypt (library that manages encryption)
libraries for various operating systems. However, on Linux systems, the bundled 
libmongocrypt library does not use the system's native encryption providers due 
to OpenSSL versioning issues. For high-performance applications on Linux, we 
recommend manually installing the libmongocrypt library and specifying its absolute 
path to the driver using the LIBMONGOCRYPT_PATH environment variable.

You can find the instructions for downloading a libmongocrypt library `here <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/queryable-encryption/reference/libmongocrypt/>`_.
